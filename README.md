### 3rd party libraries
I imported [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/) as a library that facilitate DOM manipulations and [jQuery-UI](https://code.jquery.com/ui/) as a source of datepicker. I implemented libraries using CDN for this case. On production better solution it's use Bower or NPM packages.
